# PolyProjector

This is a tool for projecting the individual shapes of a 3d model onto sheets of cardboard to create physical models. Its kind of like a poor mans laser cutter. Its build on top of the game engine Unity.

You can download a precompiled version of the app here:

After calibrating the screen. Press L on your keyboard to load the 3d model. Use < and > (command and peroid) to cycle through the faces of your model. Mouse wheel can be used to rotated the polygon for easier working. Some more information can be found in this video:
